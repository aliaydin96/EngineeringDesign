Read it carefully
The way that measurements are taken is notes in the chapter Measurements Notes.
The measuremnts have 1mm^2 resolution and eash pixel has 1mm edge length.
The obejects and the boundaries are visualized by manupulating and reorienting the measured objects' edges corners and surfaces.
You may want to recreate a plane using the measurement files named "measurement.mat.file"


			      Objects and Boundaries
*Boundary consists of 12 plates of 500mm long.
*Cylinders of 10 cm diameter.
*Cylinders of 5 cm diameter.
*Square prisms with 7 cm edge length.
*Prisms with an equilateral triangular base of 8 cm edge length.

				Mesurement Notes
*The measurements are taken 200mm away from the outward boundary.
*Four measurements are taken 90 degree apart for the cylinders.
*For sharp objects, the masurements are taken for its edges and corners.
*The boundary measurements are taken normal to 500mm away.
