//this file contains general feedbacks on the proposal report
-In the title page there is no indication about the positions of the team members.
-In executive summamry, the introduction is redundant. It exceeds one page limit for the executive summary and it is not well defined.
-In introduction, there is no mention of the next topics. It lacks of even task distribution. For example, Enes has no task different from management.
-In main body, there is no mention of objectives, requirements and funtional requirements. This part is the problamatic part. We need to review the lecture notes on Fundamental of Design.
-We have totally misunderstood the report.
-In the DS meeting, homework for standard comitee is mentioned(Is it irrelevant?).
